TODO:

- List the features of pshare
    - post link / description to facebook (possibly img files)
    - post link / description to twitter (possibly img files)
- Come up with a design for the command ie. possible flags + args, list of platforms, etc. 
- Read up on platform API's for a post

- Stuff we're gunna need:
    - argparse module (python standard lib)
    - curl (unix library)
    - possible API's

- Use API wrappers tweepy & facepy OR manually work with API's? Figure out.
    - Pro of using wrappers:
        1. heavy lifting is done for us
        2. lets us use the functionality of these heavy API interaction wrappers to create a simple CLI that lets you post to BOTH in a single ocmmand, etc.
        3. So the power of pshare would be in it's simplicity & combination of social medias. ALSO, it would be a layer on top of these wrappers, so very high level.
        4. Easier/faster to develop
        5. Goal: simple, lightweight & easy to use...how? leverage API wrappers for heavy-lifting

        API wrappers (tweepy, facepy)

        API (fb graph API, twitter API)
